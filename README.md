# protobuf_decode_gleam

Decode the protobuf wire format!

This is just a little toy I made mostly for myself. I would be happy to
polish it and make it work better, but for now this should not be used at all.
Unless you're really quite adventurous and are willing to reach out to me (my
email is on my github profile).

Also, there is currently no support for encoding the protobuf wire format.
